This is just a toy project, is a small compiled/interpreted language made for learning
the only dependency this project has is for the shell of the repl [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline)

## Why?
I wanted to learn about parsers to make an lsp(Language Server Protocol), so I started reading this [book](https://interpreterbook.com/) and this [one](https://compilerbook.com/)

## Features
- hashmaps
- arrays
- for loops
- if and else statements
- primitive values like string, integer, boolean
- everything is an expression
- closures
- compiled to bytecode
- small vm
- functions as first class
